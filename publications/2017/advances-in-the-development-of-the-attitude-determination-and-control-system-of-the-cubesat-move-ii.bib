abstract = {MOVE-II (Munich Orbital Verification Experiment) will be the first CubeSat of the Technical University of Munich (TUM) utilizing a magnetorquer-based active attitude determination and control system (ADCS). The ADCS consists of six circuit boards (five satellite side panels and one central circuit board in satellite stack), each equipped with a microcontroller, sensors and an integrated coil. The design enables redundancy and therefore forms a fault-tolerant system with respect to sensors and actuators. The paper describes the hardware implementation, algorithms, software architecture, and first test results of the integrated ADCS on the engineering unit. A possibility to upgrade and extend our software after launch will enable further research on new and innovative attitude determination and control strategies and distributed computation on satellites. The MOVE-II flight unit is in the integration and test phase with an intended launch date in early 2018.}
